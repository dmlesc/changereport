This is an app I wrote so that people could quickly and easily browse TFS checkin data. I throroughly 
enjoyed making it and learned a lot about HTML and CSS in the process.

There's lots to do to make it better, but I probably never will because I don't think it's really
used anymore as most teams have seen the light and converted to git. :)
